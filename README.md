# Setup
This repository is just for what I my setup is!

# Software
For recording I use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) with the [restream.io](https://restream.io) plugin for hosting my streams on both [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com).

For overlays I use both [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com) and [Stream Elements](https://streamelements.com/).

**Streamlabs** is used for the chat, viewer count, and alerts overlays; and **Stream Elements** is used for the goals.

I also have the plugins
